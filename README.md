# TriviaGame

In this assignment, I created a Trivia game using JavaScript for the logic and jQuery to manipulate HTML.

Created a trivia form with multiple choice options.
The player will have a limited amount of time to finish the quiz.
The game ends when the time runs out. The page will reveal the number of questions that players answer correctly and incorrectly.
